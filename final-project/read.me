My web artwork transforms the everyday act of scrolling into an experience that reflects on attention and repetition, while showing the control that social media has on people in a digital world. My web artwork mimics the structure and language of contemporary social media feeds  gradually breaking down the readability and coherence of the post, slowly numbing the brain to meaning. Rather than offering progression or resolution, the site loops, exposing how online platforms simulate movement without conclusion. The project treats scrolling not as a neutral gesture, but as a behaviour shaped and conditioned by interface design. By repeatedly inviting the user to “Load more,” my web artwork reveals how attention itself becomes the medium of the web. In my web art each stage appears to offer new content, but instead repeats familiar structures and captions that the user has seen before. Over time, the language becomes increasingly fragmented and unreadable, which mirrors how prolonged engagement and addiction often results in decaying comprehension rather than deeper understanding. 

I chose not to include assets like images, sound, video, etc because the project I chose focuses on the act of scrolling rather than the content being consumed. Keeping the site asset-light mirrors how attention is captured through interface design and repetition instead of though spectacle. This allowed interaction and navigation to function as the primary materials of my artwork.

With more time, I would extend my web art by adding moments of false agency, such as “not interested” or “see less like this,” that still loop back into the feed. This would further show the control that digital media has by showing how platforms often present choice while maintaining the same underlying behaviour. I would also degrade interface elements themselves, allowing structure and language to collapse alongside the content.

The case study, “Lost in a Garden of Clouds” is was an inspiration of mine as it presents a non-linear digital environment, which encourages the user to navigate freely through interconnected web spaces rather than following a fixed path. It treats the browser itself as an exploratory environment, where meaning emerges through movement of disorientation rather than trying to get to an end.
In my web art I wanted adopt this non-linear approach by treating navigation as a core material of the artwork. However, instead of open exploration, I wanted the experience to be deliberately constrained into an  vertical feed. “Lost in a Garden of Clouds” invites wandering and discovery, Scroll Loop replaces this with repetition which shifts the focus from spatial exploration to the temporal experience of being held in continuous motion.
