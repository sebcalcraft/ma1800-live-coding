My web artwork transforms the everyday act of scrolling into an experience that reflects on attention and repetition, while showing the control that social media has on people in a digital world. My web artwork mimics the structure and language of contemporary social media feeds  gradually breaking down the readability and coherence of the post, slowly numbing the brain to meaning. Rather than offering progression or resolution, the site loops, exposing how online platforms simulate movement without conclusion. The project treats scrolling not as a neutral gesture, but as a behaviour shaped and conditioned by interface design. By repeatedly inviting the user to “Load more,” my web artwork reveals how attention itself becomes the medium of the web. In my web art each stage appears to offer new content, but instead repeats familiar structures and captions that the user has seen before. Over time, the language becomes increasingly fragmented and unreadable, which mirrors how prolonged engagement and addiction often results in decaying comprehension rather than deeper understanding.
